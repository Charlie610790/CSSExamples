Examples Of Css

This assignment was to demonstrate 30 unique examples of CSS.  These could be simple examples like buttons to more complex animations and transitions.  This was easily the best CSS assignment of the Iron Yard class as over the weekend I was able to experiment with many different aspects of CSS which I had not attempted to use yet.  Some examples of things used were:

Box-Shadow
Border-Radius
Transitions
Vendor Prefixes
Active/Hover States
Animations
Keyframes
Background Images
Other General CSS Settings

Overall the 30 examples range from transitioning images to rotating and moving animations but this was a very helpful assignment.
